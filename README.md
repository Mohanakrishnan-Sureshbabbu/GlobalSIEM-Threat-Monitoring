# üåê Global SIEM Threat Monitoring & SOAR Automation

## Project Title: Global SIEM Threat Monitoring ‚Äì 2023

| Technology Stack | Automation Platform | Compliance Focus | Performance Uplift |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **Splunk Enterprise** | **Phantom SOAR** | **GDPR & FCA** | **40% Faster Triage** |

A critical security engineering project focused on deploying and optimizing a next-generation **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)** system with integrated **Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response (SOAR)** capabilities to accelerate incident handling and ensure regulatory compliance.

---

## ‚ú® Project Overview

We successfully deployed **Splunk Enterprise** coupled with **Phantom SOAR** to centralize threat intelligence and automate the initial stages of the incident response lifecycle. This implementation included creating sophisticated **correlation rules** and establishing **automated alert triage workflows**, directly addressing challenges in security response time and regulatory adherence.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology & Frameworks

| Category | Tool / Framework | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **SIEM Platform** | **Splunk Enterprise** | Centralized log ingestion, aggregation, and analysis for threat detection. |
| **Automation** | **Phantom SOAR** | Automated playbook execution for alert enrichment, triage, and response actions. |
| **Threat Intelligence**| **MITRE ATT&CK Framework** | Structured mapping of adversary tactics and techniques to enhance correlation rule fidelity and context. |

## üìä Deployment & Configuration

### Dataset / Installation

The core of the system relies on high-fidelity security data feeds and custom configurations:

* **Data Sources:** Ingestion of real-time **SIEM log feeds** from all critical **endpoints** and network infrastructure.
* **Visualization:** Development of custom **Splunk dashboards** powered by optimized search queries for executive reporting and analyst use.
* **Automation Logic:** Integration of robust **Phantom playbooks** specifically designed for automated alert enrichment and intelligent triage.

### üåê Deployment Methodology

A standardized, compliance-first deployment approach was utilized to ensure seamless and secure integration across the hybrid environment:

1.  **Hybrid Deployment:** Splunk Enterprise nodes were strategically deployed across the **hybrid IT environment** to maximize log coverage.
2.  **Alert Routing:** All high-severity alerts were configured to be instantaneously routed from Splunk to the **Phantom SOAR** platform.
3.  **Rule Mapping:** All threat correlation rules were meticulously mapped against the **MITRE ATT&CK Framework** for standardized threat identification and context.

## üìà Results & Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

The implementation delivered significant, quantifiable security and compliance improvements:

| KPI Category | Metric Achieved | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Incident Response** | **40% Faster Incident Triage** | Dramatically reduced the Mean Time To Acknowledge (MTTA) for security alerts through automation. |
| **Threat Detection** | **Real-time Threat Detection** | Provided comprehensive, immediate visibility into emerging threats across all managed endpoints. |
| **Regulatory Compliance** | **Ensured GDPR & FCA Compliance** | Automated logging, retention, and reporting processes met stringent requirements for regulatory bodies. |

## üî≠ Future Scope & Roadmap

To maintain a leading security posture, future initiatives include:

* **Advanced Analytics:** Integrate machine learning models into the SIEM for sophisticated **anomaly detection** and behavioral profiling.
* **Cloud Expansion:** Expand SIEM and SOAR coverage to include logging and monitoring for **cloud-native workloads** (e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP).
